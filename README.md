Welcome to LA2T!

Here we will explain the setup process and how to use our tool.

First, make sure you have python3-pip successfully installed on your machine.
On Ubuntu, you can run the ' sudo apt install python3-pip ' command

Once you have pip installed. You can go ahead and download the LA2T Folder which contains everything necessary.

Once you have the folder on your machine, follow these steps below:

1. Make sure to change your current working directory to the LA2T folder. It should say something like ' ubuntu@ubuntu2004:~/Desktop/LA2T$ '
2. Once that is done, all you need to do, is run ' ./setup.sh ' This command installs all necessary modules and ensures all scripts are able to run on your machine.
3. Finally, run command ' python3 web_app.py ' and you will successfully have the LA2T web application running.
4. On your browser, type the localhost link ' 127.0.0.1:5000 ' . This will then show you our web application and you are free to browse around.


We thank you for your support and we hope you find LA2T to be useful and helpful for your works. :)
